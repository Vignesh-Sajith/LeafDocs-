                 LeafDoc is a lightweight, AI-driven program designed to assist farmers and plant enthusiasts in identifying diseases affecting 
                 plants through their leaves. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to detect common diseases and assess the crop yield 
                 of various plants, enhancing crop management and overall plant health. Users can access the service via a web app, allowing them to 
                 scan images of their plant leaves for disease detection.



                 ### The Team (Sharjah Indian School Boys - Juwaiza )
                 1. Our little team , consisting of Vignesh, Ken and Prabhav are a few tinkering programmers who got inspired to take on some 
                    some big challenges in the area of machine learning, CNN (Convolution Neural Network), Image Classification etc. 
                    to solve some major problems in the largest employemnt sector of India, Agriculture. 
                 2. The devastating crop loss of multiple distasters in the field of agriculture; have motivated us to make this
                    as our final project for this exhibition, a remarkable tool that every farmer who toils hard will appreciate and use.
                 3. We intend this project to be a testimoney towards the intense need for integration of latest AI and ML technologies 
                    in the agriculture sectors, we as students are limited, more than a useful tool, our intention with this project is 
                    to spread an idea, that will reverberate throughout the economy.
                 4. We kindly request anyone who may have stumbled upon our little achievement, to share to for the benefit of others.

                 ### Why Choose Us?
                 - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
                 - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
                 - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

                 ### Our Services:
                 1. Our main service is leaf diesease detection program that we address as "LeafDoc", which can be accessed via the Diesease 
                  Recognition Page.
                 2. We Have also made our own independent datasets using Perplexity to make a Pest Outbreak Early Warning System.
                 3. By extracting Databases from kaggle, a complex crop yeild prediction software is also availible.
                 4. For the benefit of rural farmers, we have integrated a special tab, used for gaining intel on latest Governemnt Schemes. 

                 ### How did we make it?
                 You may wonder how we managed to pull such a project with no experience, I will provide a bibliography that contains links to
                 the various resources that was used by us throughout the duration of the project. But in short, a few stressfull weeks, 
                 many cups of coffee ‚òï and lots of stackoverflow scrolling seemed to have done the trick :)
    
                 This project would never have been possible if it werent for the contunuing support of our teachers and senior coders who helped 
                 us make our vision come to life. I sincerlly Thank them all!""")

        #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this GitHub repo. 
                This dataset consists of about 87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset 
                is divided into an 80/20 ratio of training and validation sets, preserving the directory structure. 
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purposes.
                
                #### Content
                1. **Train** (70,295 images)
                2. **Test** (33 images)
                3. **Validation** (17,572 images)

                #### HOW TO USE THE PLANT DISEASE DETECTION AI
                1. **First**, pluck the leaf and place it on a surface with a black or dark background, ensuring good lighting.
                2. **Take a picture** and upload the image on the website. Our AI model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
                    and image classification to identify the disease of the plant.
                3. **How to use the crop yield prediction AI**: Select your country and the crop to be grown from the dropdown list. 
                    Enter details such as annual rainfall (in mm per year), average temperature, and the amount of pesticides used per 
                    tonne (tonnes of active ingredients).
                4. Our AI model will predict the approximate yield of the crop under the specified conditions.

    

                #### Purpose of Our Project
                In recent years, India has faced numerous challenges in agriculture, leading to significant impacts on farmers and food security. 
                These challenges have highlighted the urgent need for innovative solutions to support our agricultural community. Motivated by the desire 
                to empower farmers and enhance their resilience against various adversities, we embarked on this project. Our goal is to provide effective 
                tools and resources that not only address current agricultural issues but also promote sustainable practices for the future.
